<h3>What is Veins of the Earth?</h3>
<p>Veins of the Earth is a free open source roguelike with RPG elements, in development since <b>2012</b>. </p>
<p>The RPG ruleset was originally conceived based on the d20 dice. Currently we use d100.</p>
<h3>Versions</h3>
<p>The project has gone through several rewrites, in different programming languages and libraries.</p>
<p>All versions are open source and available from <a href="https://github.com/Zireael07?tab=repositories">Github repositories</a>.</p>
<p>The only version that was actually distributed more widely was the original iteration, made in <a href="https://te4.org/">T-Engine</a> - <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/the-veins-of-the-earth">ModDB link</a>.</p>
<p>In fact, distribution problems are a main reason why the current iteration is a web game.</p>
<h3>System requirements</h3>
<p>Depending on the version, they differ. Most versions should run on just about anything, provided you have the IDE for the programming language used, and the source code.</p>
<p>T-Engine requires some OpenGL support and will not run on old video cards.</p>
<p>Similarly, the current Godot iteration requires OpenGL 3.</p>
